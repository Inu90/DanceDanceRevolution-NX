DanceDanceRevolution NX is a Stepmania theme based off the excellent DDR A theme released by MadkaT, Risk, pkwp, and KENp.

This theme is still a work in progress.

As of now and probably for a while going forward, the theme only supports single play event mode. 2 player and doubles might be implemented in the future but it would probably take a while as everything so far has been tailored towards a single player, single pad experience.

There is a decent amount of polish I'd still like to add, particularly in ScreenStageInformation and possibly the transition/attract screens and profile select.

Please let me know of anything that irks you, things you'd want added if possible, or anything that seems out of place or needs tidying/polish.

Thank you for testing!
