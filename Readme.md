DanceDanceRevolution NX is a Stepmania 5.1.12 theme based off the excellent DDR A theme released by MadkaT, Risk, pkwp, and KENp.

This theme is still a work in progress. As such there are several file name errors that are in the present build that will not be present in the final release. I'd recommend using the theme in full screen using SM 5.1.12 for the time being to avoid these errors.

As of now and probably for a while going forward, the theme only supports single play event mode. 2 player and doubles might be implemented in the future but it would probably take a while as everything so far has been tailored towards a single player, single pad experience.

There is a decent amount of polish I'd still like to add. Please let me know of anything that irks you, things you'd want added if possible, or anything that seems out of place or needs tidying/polish.

Thank you for testing!
